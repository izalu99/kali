# Kali

Kali is a digital library of Kankanaey words (in Roman characters) with their definitions and/or translations in English. The project aims to preserve one of the spoken dialects in the northern Philippines while making it accessible to anyone interested. Additionally, Kali serves as a learning experience to explore how various technologies work together, especially with server-side rendering, new server components, and client components.
