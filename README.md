# Kali

Kali is a digital library of kankanaey words (in roman characters). Their definitions and/or translations are in english.
The purpose is for preserving one of spoken dialects in the Northern parts of the Philippines as well as making it acessible to anyone interested to it.
Also, for me to learn how the technologies listed below work together.

## Features

- **Search Functionality**: Quickly search for words and their translations.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Browse**: Look for words with the letters they start with.

### Future Features to include

- allow a list of definitions/ translations to a word.
- api

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **Next.js**: Framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **Turso**: SQLite compatible database built on libsql.
- **Drizzle**: A lightweight ORM that's SQL like. 
- **GraphQL**: To build schema and to enforce the types of the data coming from and going to the database.
- **Apollo Client**: State management library for GraphQL.
- **FontAwesome**: Icon library for adding icons.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Clerk**: Authentication and user management.
- **Contentful**: For content management. It's probably overkill right now, in the early stages but I wanted to learn it and also for future scaling or change of maintainer.
